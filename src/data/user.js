		description:
			"Coding was invented because humans clearly needed more ways to suffer… some say it's logical, I say it's a prank by machines. I write code, it writes errors back, laughs at me, and keeps me humble. The first computer bug was literally a moth in a machine, so apparently computers have always been drama queens. Here I am, riding the chaos with Pixels, Python, and pure chaos as my sidekicks because why make things easy when you can make them dramatic?",

	about: {
		title: "I'm Bishwas, I use Arch Btw.",
		description:
			"I specialize in full-stack web development and AI/Computer Vision, which means I write code and computers write back in errors. I've wrestled with Python, Django, Flask, FastAPI, and frontend gremlins like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, sometimes winning, sometimes not, mostly not. Databases like MySQL and Supabase just sit there, silently judging every bad decision I make. I solve 'complex problems' that probably hate me as much as I hate them. Somehow, I keep typing, debugging, and pretending this chaos is fun.",
